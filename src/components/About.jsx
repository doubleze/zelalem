                <p className="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-600">
                  My professional journey began as a Junior Hardware Engineer, where I regularly maintained ATM and card printer hardware. This role provided a solid technical foundation, but my growing interest in software propelled me to the Information Security Agency as an Application Developer. There, I engaged in full-stack development for an ERP system that digitized operations worth over $4 billion annually, conducting strategic business analyses and providing enterprise architecture for the Electric Single Window project.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-600">
                  My career then progressed at the Ministry of Revenue, where I served as a Software Quality Assurance Senior Officer, establishing stringent quality standards for an electronic tax collection system. My leadership skills flourished as I became a Senior Software Programmer at the Ministry of Transport and Logistics, enhancing a fuel subsidy system that processed 120,000 daily transactions. These experiences refined my technical and management abilities, preparing me for more significant challenges.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-600">
                  In my last role, as an ERP Product Manager at Kegeberew Technology Solution, I oversee product development from requirements to deployment, achieving a remarkable 70% reduction in operational costs. This role blends my technical expertise with strategic oversight, ensuring successful project execution and customer satisfaction. Throughout my journey, I have embraced challenges, continuously learning and adapting, and I am passionate about leading teams to deliver innovative solutions that drive efficiency and impact.
